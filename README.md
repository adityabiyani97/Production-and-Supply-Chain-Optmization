# Production-and-Supply-Chain-Optmization

This was a validation project where the results from the paper by Kopanos et al, 2011 were replicated in GAMS using a MIP solvers like CPLEX and XPRESS. 
The overview of the paper is as follows: 
The objective of the paper is to develop an approach to simultaneously perform production planning and scheduling of continuous parallel units that can produce a large number of products. The final products can thus be classified into several different families. The paper describes an efficient mixed integer programming formulation for the production planning and scheduling with sequence-dependent switchover times and costs for product families and sequence-independent switchover times and costs for product families in the same period. (Kopanos, Puigjaner, & Maravelias, 2011)
The optimization goal is to minimize the total inventory, backlog, changeover (within and across periods), and setup and operating costs.
